# Securing Software Supply Chains with SLSA 

In recent years, the cybersecurity landscape has been rattled by two significant events: the SolarWinds and Codecov attacks. These breaches not only underscore the vulnerability of software supply chains but also highlight the urgent need for robust security measures to safeguard against such threats. With adversaries increasingly targeting the software development process itself, the imperative for ensuring the integrity and trustworthiness of every component within the supply chain has never been more apparent.

## Enter SLSA

Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts, or SLSA ("salsa") is a security framework, a checklist of standards and controls to prevent tampering, improve integrity, and secure packages and infrastructure.
